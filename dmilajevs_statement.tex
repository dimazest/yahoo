I am a third year PhD student at Queen Mary University of London doing computational linguistics. Languages always intrigued me and the fact that it is possible to process such a complex phenomena using computers always inspires and excites me. My thesis is about distributional semantics, a field that studies meaning representation of words, sentences and texts.

Knowing how similar are the meaning of two words, one can solve English language tests, generate a dictionary and discover new usage of words, improve web search and improve advertisements.

My main research topic is to extend the "word-level" methods to sentences and documents. This will enable the application of distributional semantics to dialogue processing, paraphrase detection, document clustering and classification, and many other tasks.

The methods I work build sentence meaning the same way a chef prepares food: a dish is made out of ingredients which are combined together following a recipe. In this analogy the ingredients are words and the recipe is the grammatical structure of a sentence and the chief is an algorithm.

Daniele Quercia's talk about attractiveness of different parts of London at WWW 2013 got my attention to the work done at Yahoo Labs. Since then I have seen a lot of papers that were done by Yahoo interns and decided that it would be nice to apply there some day. The work of others is not the only reason I apply for the internship, access to a large amount of data and a large scale computing infrastructure are the two other lucrative factors.

I wish to work with Fabrizio Silvestri and Peter Mika to see how distributional word and sentence meaning representations can be applied to retrieval and advertisement.
